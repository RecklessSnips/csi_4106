# Overview
Assignment 3 focused on the supervised-learning pipeline, including data cleaning, preprocessing, and training
a feed-forward neural network (FNN).
Assignment 4 explored heuristic optimization by implementing Greedy Algorithms, Simulated Annealing, 
and Genetic Algorithms for the Traveling Salesman Problem.

# A3
I implemented and analyzed an FNN. I applied techniques such as early  stopping, L2 regularization, and
dropout to improve generalization. I also explored different hyperparameters by varying the number of layers,
hidden units, and activation functions. My best model achieved an F1 score of 0.878 and an ROC-AUC of 0.954
on the test dataset, showing a slight improvement over my Random Forest model from Assignment 2, which 
had an F1-score of 0.843.

# A4
I implemented and evaluated Simulated Annealing (SA) and Genetic Algorithms (GA) for the TSP, tuning parameters
and analyzing how each algorithm balances exploration, exploitation, and runtime efficiency.
